# no driver path at all). Two things differ, and only two:
#
#   1. Codex sets no CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT, so `cos` is resolved relative to this
#      script. The driver next to it is a real copy of the canonical
#      claude-code-plugin/scripts/cos, written by scripts/sync-shared.sh —
#      symlinks are not an option, the Codex installer copies regular files only.
#   2. No ${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT} warning: that variable does not exist here.

The sandbox driver is at: $cos
$where
If the driver cannot be run, stop and say so; do not substitute raw \`createos sandbox\` primitives, which drop egress restriction, keepalive, auto-destroy, and the auth preflight.

Picking the verb (get this right before running anything):
- Work with a finish line — run a test suite, a build, a script: \`cos offload <dir> '<cmd>'\`. ONE command. It creates the box, ships <dir> for you, runs, and destroys the box. Do NOT tar, base64, or push files in by hand, and do NOT use \`cos up\` for this.
- Work that must outlive one command — a dev server you'll hit repeatedly, a watcher, a multi-command session: \`cos up\`, then \`cos run\`, then \`cos pause\` or \`cos down\`.
- \`cos run\` takes the command as one plain string; there is no \`--\` separator. Run \`$cos help\` for the full verb list, and read the using-createos-sandbox skill before anything involving egress restriction, networking, or file sync."
