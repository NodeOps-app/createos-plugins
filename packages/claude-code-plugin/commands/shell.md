Instant scratch Linux (keyless). `cos shell` creates a disposable box, opens an interactive shell, and destroys it when you exit. Egress defaults to unrestricted (any host); `-e <domain>`/`-p <preset>` restrict to an exact set, or `-E` to keep it explicitly unrestricted.

**Interactive — it takes over the terminal**, so it can't run as a foreground agent command. Run it yourself: type `!cos shell` in the Claude prompt (add flags like `-s s-2vcpu-2gb` or `-e`/`-p`/`-E` as needed) — `cos` needs `scripts/cos install` first, or invoke it by full path (`!"$CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT"/scripts/cos shell`).

!`echo "Run interactively in your own terminal:  !cos shell   (flags: -s <shape> -r <rootfs> -e <dom>|-p <preset>|-E; default egress is unrestricted; needs 'scripts/cos install' first, or invoke by full path). It creates a throwaway box, opens a shell, and destroys it on exit."`
